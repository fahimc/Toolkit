Wezside Toolkit
===============

This is a hub for components I've written and re-use quite often. All components are based on a component architecture with the core being 
UIElement. Read more on <a href="#uielement">UIElement</a> below.

Latest release 
=======

* Build 0.1.0179
* Compiled with Flex 4 SDK build 14159 


Change log since build .0100
=======

* FillLayout layout decorator added (still in testing phase)
* XMLDataMapper now includessupport for percentage values in attributes 
* StyleManager has been updated to allow for instantiating the style class and listening for the EVENT.COMPLETE event. Previously the EVENT.COMPLETE was not invoked due to the instantiating happening so quickly.
* Label now supports a few more default properties
* Scale9 issue resolved when setting scale9Grid after arrange() is called. Now you can set either before or after arrange() on a ShapeRectangle Shape decorator.
* Support for scale9grid added to ShapeRectangle
* Rectangle Shape decorator refactored to ShapeRectangle
* Shape decorator width and height properties updated to set Sprite width and height if arrange() has been called before
* New Horizontal scroll decorator added. Minimum requirement is to set scrollWidth as with ScrollVertical where it is scrollHeight
* Fixed bug in XMLDataMapper when mapping nodes with CDATA to text property
* Fixed numChildren methods to return correct values
* Updated Shape decorator to include individual corner radius properties bottomRightRadius, bottomLeftRadius, topRightRadius, topLeftRadius
* Refactored decorators to namespace com.wezside.components.decorators
* Include new Interactive decorator InteractiveSelectable which behaves as a toggle. The default now is single click and button won't stay selected.
* Fixed bug with setStyle() on UIElement with no styleName set
* UIElement purge() updated to remove scroll, arrange listener and stateManager purge()
* UIElement addChildAt() and addUIChildAt() methods added
* New Button + Label components added - better support for decorators through CSS 
* New decorator added: Interactive - changes any UIElement into a button. 
* Added support for automatically assigning Class names as styleNames
* Removed inheritCSS and parent injection of styleName and styleManager to children. Explicitely set what is needed on each UIElement instead. This proves
cleaner code and more readable from a third perspective.
* Refactor addSuperChild and remvoeSuperChild to addUIChild and removeUIChild to avoid confusion.
* UIELement update() method removed and no recursion. SetStyle() will still use its rules to inject styleManager instance and the 
inheritance of the parent styleName
* Basic Vertical Scroll decorator implemented
* Support for automatic CSS  prop lookup  in StyleManager
* Modulo inject styleManager instance into IModule 
* Swapped hierarchy of skin DisplayObject and childContainer
* StateManager fixed compare bug
* Added setSize( w, h ) method for UIElementSkin 
* Expose StateManager property in UIElement

Accordion
---------

A bare-bones Accordion component. Extend Accordion and AccordionItem to customise this component and add animations when 
state changes.

		var itemA:IAccordionItem = new AccordionItem();
		itemA.header = headerDisplayObject;
		itemA.content = contentDisplayObject; 
			
		var acc:Accordion = new Accordion();
		acc.addItem( itemA );
		addChild( acc );
		
Gallery
-------

A framework for building advanced Gallery components. Supports grid layouts and custom transitions. Useful just as is or with extended functionality. 
The creation policy for this component is to construct and purge a gallery per page. This allows for only loading the images required on screen. This impacts
transitions where it is required to have the next items visible on screen before the current gallery items have been removed. 

[Example](http://www.sony.com/football/#/cfcfootballhd/ "Gallery Example")

		gallery = new Gallery( items, 
							   COLUMNS, 
							   ROWS,
							   0, 						// xOffset
							   0, 						// yOffset
							   2, 						// Horizontal Gap
							   2, 						// Vertical Gap
							   "left", 					// Horizontal Align
							   "custom",				// Click through target
							   1,   					// Reflection Height In Rows
							   0.3, 					// Reflection Alpha
							   Gallery.RESIZE_HEIGHT,	// Resize Policy 
							   80, 						// Resize Value
							   Gallery.DISTRIBUTE_H, 	// Distribute Policy
							   false, 					// Show Arrangement
							   550,  					// Stage width
							   500,  					// Stage height
							   true, 					// Disable CTA for all thumbnails
							   false );					// Debug
		gallery.x = 50;
		gallery.y = 30;
		gallery.addEventListener( GalleryEvent.ARRANGE_COMPLETE, galleryArrangeComplete );
		addChildAt( gallery, 0 );

		
StateManager
------------

A useful class to manage application state. The reserved property on an IState instance is used for 
application state that will only affect itself. Reserved states are not mutually exclusive, they are allowed to co-exist 
with non-reserved and other reserved states. 

		var sm:StateManager = new StateManager();
		sm.addState( "Credentials", true );
		sm.addState( "Register" );
		sm.addState( "List" );
		sm.addState( "Search" );
		sm.addState( "Results" );
		
		sm.state = "Credentials";				// State == 1
		sm.state = "Credentials";				// State == 0
		sm.state = "Credentials";				// State == 1
		sm.state = "Register";					// State == 3
		sm.previousState().key					// Result is "Credentials"	
		sm.state = "Credentials";				// State == 2


TimelineManager
---------------

A simple class to deal with timeline animations. Manage timeline animations playback, removal and 
end frame behaviour. A play policy exist to allow for playing back multiple animations at once or 
in sequence starting at a specific animation or simply play a single (default) animation.


		public function VisualTestTimelineManager()
		{
			tm = new TimelineManager();			
			mc1 = new Animation01();
			mc2 = new Animation02();		
			mc3 = new Animation03();
			tm.addEventListener( TimelineEvent.READY, ready );
			tm.addEventListener( TimelineEvent.COMPLETE, complete );
			tm.addEventListener( TimelineEvent.SEQUENTIAL_COMPLETE, sequenceComplete );
			tm.addElement( "1", mc1, 0, -1, false,  TimelineManager.CHILD_POLICY_RECURSIVE );
			tm.addElement( "2", mc2, 0, 30, false, TimelineManager.CHILD_POLICY_RECURSIVE );
			tm.addElement( "3", mc3, 0, -1, false, TimelineManager.CHILD_POLICY_RECURSIVE );
												
			addChild( mc3 );
			addChild( mc2 );			
			addChild( mc1 );				
		}

		private function complete( event:TimelineEvent ):void 
		{
			trace( "End Frame reached " + event.index );
		}

		private function ready( event:TimelineEvent ):void 
		{
			if ( event.total == 3 )
			{
				tm.play();
			}
		}

		protected function sequenceComplete( event:TimelineEvent):void
		{
			trace( "Sequence complete ");					
			mc1.removeChildAt(0);
			mc2.removeChildAt(0);
			mc3.removeChildAt(0);
			removeChild( mc3 );
			removeChild( mc2 );			
			removeChild( mc1 );
			
			Animation01 = null;
			Animation02 = null;
			Animation03 = null;
			
			tm.purge();
			tm = null;				
			mc1 = null;
			mc2 = null;		
			mc3 = null;			
		}

UIElement
---------

A component architecture for pure Actionscript components to allow for easy integration with Modulo's [StyleManager](http://github.com/wezside/Toolkit/blob/master/src/com/wezside/utilities/manager/styleManager/StyleManager.as "StyleManager").

*Features*

* Support for visual states and styling through CSS
* Decorator support for shape, layout, interactive and scrollbar

**The Architecture**

Each UIElement is considered to be a standalone component. The API allows for transformation through CSS and something known as decorator. A decorator simply 
decorates an object (in this case UIElement) into something different. Think of it as changing the behaviour of an object. 
Currently 4 types of decorators exist, ILayout, IShape, IInteractive and IScroll.

**Factory Methods**

*build()* A method used for adding children of a UIElement to the stage in the correct order. Children here refers to decorators and custom added children

*setStyle()* A method used to apply a CSS style. Requirement for usage is for the properties *styleManager* and *styleName* to be valid. 

*arrange()* A method that arranges children of a UIElement through a layout decorator. 

**UI Decorators**

All UIElement decorators are commutitative. This means the order does not matter. The order of the factory methods (build(), setStyle() and arrange()) does however 
matter. build() is required whereas setStyle() and arrange() is optional based on the usage of the component.

**Simple UI CSS Example**

A simple example showcasing the usage of the StyleManager and applying a CSS style to a UIElement. The order of the methods build(), setStyle() and arrange() is 
important for the decorators and children of the UIElement. 

	mockUIElement = new UIElement();
	mockUIElement.styleName = "title";
	mockUIElement.styleManager = styleManager;
	mockUIElement.build();
	mockUIElement.setStyle();
	mockUIElement.arrange();

**Vertical Layout Decorator Example**

The layout decorator as with any other decorator should always be applied before calling the factory methods build(), setStyle() and arrange(). 

	mockUIElement = new MockUIElement();
	mockUIElement.layout = new VerticalLayout( mockUIElement );
	mockUIElement.build();
	mockUIElement.arrange();
	
**Chaining Vertical and Padded Layout Decorator Example**

Layout decorators can be chained.

	mockUIElement = new MockUIElement();
	mockUIElement.layout = new VerticalLayout( mockUIElement );
	mockUIElement.layout.verticalGap = 5;
	mockUIElement.layout = new PaddedLayout( mockUIElement.layout );
	mockUIElement.layout.left = 5;
	mockUIElement.layout.right = 5;
	mockUIElement.build();
	mockUIElement.arrange();
	
**Decorator Shape for creating a background**

Each UIElement has a pre-built background decorator. It is reserved and therefore will always be at index 0. The background will automatically resize itself based on 
the UIElement's layout decorator if defined. Alternatively the size can be set through *width* and *height* properties. To show a background make sure *colors* and 
*alphas* is set with at least 2 values. Also make sure to call *arrange()* for the background to autosize if required. 
 
	mockUIElement = new MockUIElement();
	mockUIElement.background = new Rectangle( mockUIElement );
	mockUIElement.background.colours = [ 0, 0 ];
	mockUIElement.background.alphas = [ 1, 1 ];
	mockUIElement.build();
	mockUIElement.arrange();
	
**Decorator Scroll for creating a Vertical Scrollbar**
	mockUIElement = new MockUIElement();
	mockUIElement.scroll = new ScrollVertical( mockUIElement );
	mockUIElement.scroll.scrollHeight = 150; 
	mockUIElement.scroll.horizontalGap = 2;
	mockUIElement.build();
	mockUIElement.arrange();
	
**Interactive Decorator Example**

Each UIElement has a default Interactive decorator which converts its behaviour into a button. 

	mockUIElement = new MockUIElement();
	mockUIElement.build();
	mockUIElement.arrange();
	mockUIElement.activate();
