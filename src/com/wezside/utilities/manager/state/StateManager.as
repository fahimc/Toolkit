	/**
	 * @author Wesley.Swanepoel
	 * <p></p>
	 * <p>
	 * A useful class to manage application or component state. The reserved property on an IState instance is used for 
	 * application state which should only affect itself. 
	 * </p>
	 * <p></p>
	 * <p><b>Reserved States</b></p>
	 * <p>
	 * Reserved states are not mutually exclusive, they are allowed to co exist with non-reserved and other reserved states. 
	 * </p>
	 * <p></p>
	 * <p><b>Example</b></p>
	 * <p>
	 * An example of this is the Credential state, i.e. logged in vs not logged in.
	 * Multiple other states could exist with both of these application states however to each other the two
	 * are mutually exclusive. Therefore a single state is used to indicate if a user is logged in or not. If a user is logged in 
	 * the state in question's value will be added to the current state. If not logged in the state's value won't be added. 
	 * </p>

	 * http://www.moock.org/asdg/technotes/bitwise/
